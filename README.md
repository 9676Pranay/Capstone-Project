Predicting MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) personality types using deep learning is an intriguing yet challenging task in natural language processing and classification. This paper outlines the methodology for constructing an effective deep learning model for personality type prediction. The MBTI, with its 16 distinct personality types, serves as a valuable framework for understanding individuals' cognitive preferences and behavior.
